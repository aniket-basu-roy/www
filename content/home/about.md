# About

I am a PhD student at the Department of [Computer Science and Automation](http://www.csa.iisc.ac.in) in [Indian Institute of Science](http://www.iisc.ac.in) located in Bangalore, India. My thesis advisor is [Prof. Sathish Govindarajan](http://drona.csa.iisc.ac.in/~gsat). I am broadly interested in the areas of theoretical computer science that have combinatorial flavor to it. So far, I have explored few computationally hard geometric optimization problems and tried to design approximation algorithms for them.

I am expecting to submit my thesis soon and look out for post-doc positions.
