title = "Maximum Independent Set of Rectangles â€” A Survey"
abstract = "Consider a family of axis-parallel rectangles in the plane. We want to find the maximum sized subset of the family such that no two rectangles intersect. The problem is known to be NP-Hard for more than 3 decades. It was only in 2009 that Chalermsook and Chuzhoy [SODA '09] gave a polynomial time $O(\\log\\log n)$-approximation algorithm for the problem. Whereas for the weighted version of the problem, there is only an $O(\\logn / \\log\\log n)$-approximation algorithm known, due to Chan and Har-Peled [SoCG '09, DCG '12]. Even more recently, Adamaszek and Wiese [FOCS '13] gave a QPTAS for this problem, which rules out the possibility of APX-Hardness of the problem under usual complexity theoretic assumptions. Thus, the wide open question is to find a PTAS or at least a constant factor approximation algorithm. In this talk we will go through the paper by Chalermsook and Chuzhoy that gave an $O(\\log\\log n)$-approximation algorithm."
