title = "Packing and Covering with Geometric Objects"

abstract = "We study a host of Geometric optimization problems that are computationally hard and design polynomial time approximation algorithms for them. Particularly, we consider different Packing and Covering problems and show that they admit Polynomial Time Approximation Schemes (PTAS) using local search algorithms. More precisely, we are given a family of geometric objects and a point set in the plane and we study different variants of Packing and Covering problems viz., Shallow Packing, Point Packing, Runaway Rectangle Escape problem, Unique Coverage, Multi-Covering problem, Prize Collecting Set Cover, and few Art Gallery problems. These problems have a wide range of applications in map labeling, wireless and sensor networks, routing in printed circuit boards, and of course, guarding art galleries. Local Search algorithm paradigm has been a popular heuristic since long. It is only recently that it has been theoretically proved to guarantee good approximation for geometric problems. The algorithm per se is very simple to state. One starts with some feasible solution and at every iteration makes 'small' changes, retaining the feasibility and improving the objective function. When it cannot be improved one returns the current solution. A framework is known for geometric problems where this algorithm is a PTAS algorithm that yields the best possible approximation in polynomial time provided one can show the existence of a graph with some 'nice' properties. We consider the above-mentioned problems and show the existence of respective graphs with those 'nice' properties for a broad class of geometric objects."
